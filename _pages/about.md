I'm a PhD student in *Sociology* in a cotutelle agreement between the University of Milan, Italy ([NASP](https://www.nasp.eu/) programme) and the University of Agder, Norway. I have a background in philosophy of science and my main research interest right now is the choice of research topics and the factors -- social, institutional, etc. -- affecting it.

I'm very interested in the opportunities offered by the approaches of *Computational Social Sciences* and *Digital Humanities*. Right now I'm working with tecniques borrowed from Natural Language Processing (like Topic Modeling), Network Analysis and Agent-Based Modeling.

I got my MA in *Logic, Philosophy and History of Science* at the University of Florence with a dissertation about the history of cellular automata and a BA in *Philosophy* at the University of Turin with dissertation about peer-review in research assessment and it's limits.
